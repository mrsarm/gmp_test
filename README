gmp_test C-project
==================

This is just a test example project.

The only purpose of this project is to use as a test
for *GMP library*, and as an example of how to import
this library in a *CMakes* project.

The project uses *CMakes* to build the executable.

1. From the source directory, generate the "Makefile":

    $ cmake .

2. *Make* the project and generate the executable "gmp_test".

    $ make

3. Then execute with:

    $ out/gmp_test

To clean the compiled binaries and compiled modules:

    $ make clean

To clean all compiled files and generated "Makefiles":

    $ make clean-all
